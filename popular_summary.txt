Competition between languages affects the lives of people all over the globe, and between 50% and 90% of all languages are estimated to become extinct by the end of the century. Here we use methods inspired by statistical physics to study the decline of real languages, in particular, Cornish and Welsh -- two of Great Britain's Celtic languages. We simulate the decline of these languages by taking into account geographical features, population distribution, and people's interaction patterns. Our simulations reproduce many of the features found in the historical data, and suggests that geographical features may play a key role in how languages disappear.
